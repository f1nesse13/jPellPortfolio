        <p>
          I am a 32 year old fullstack developer working with mostly Rails and
          React. Although they are the main technologies I use for web
          applications I use some Ruby for scripting and have some knowledge of
          nodejs for backend programming. Some other tools I am familiar with
          are SQL and NoSQL databases such as postgres, SQLite and mongoDB as
          well as experience consuming and creating RESTful APIs.

          I've been writing code on and off since high school and have always
          had a passion for it. I decided to follow a career in the automotive
          industry which turned into a job in management. This gave me many
          skills that still assist me to this day. Although I enjoyed my work I
          made the decision to stay home when my first child was born. As time
          has gone on I've sharpened my skills and began taking development more
          seriously, consuming information from every source I could find.
          Development really draws me in and allows me to be creative, at times
          it is hard for me to tear myself away. I am a a great problem solver
          and love to be challenged. Development is a perfect fit for my
          skillset.

          As I become more entrenched in development I see myself leaning more
          and more towards the frontend - specifically with React. Although I
          really enjoy backend programming I see myself gravitating towards the
          frontend. So if I had to describe my speciality I would say I'm a
          fullstack developer specializing in React. Im my schooling we focused
          on full stack development with Ruby and Javascript. We started with
          Ruby fundamentals and moved onto Rails rather quickly. My skills in
          writing Ruby code became more and more refined. A lot of work I did
          with Ruby naturally led me to questions about computer science topics
          that I was then able to apply to Javascript and all other technologies
          I used afterwards. When we started Javascript I was familiar with it
          but had forgotten a lot of what I knew before. As with Ruby I quickly
          became accoustomed to writing Javascript and later, React all over
          again. Its been a fun journey to this point and I look forward to
          continue learning about new technology as I continue my career.
